## Current Implementation

### Core Features
- **Sixteen Entities**: Complete portfolio monitoring with balance, performance, transfer tracking, and diagnostics
  - `SaxoCashBalanceSensor` from `/port/v1/balances/me` (with long-term statistics)
  - `SaxoTotalValueSensor` from `/port/v1/balances/me` (with long-term statistics)
  - `SaxoNonMarginPositionsValueSensor` from `/port/v1/balances/me` (with long-term statistics)
  - `SaxoAccumulatedProfitLossSensor` from `/hist/v3/perf/` (with long-term statistics)
  - `SaxoInvestmentPerformanceSensor` from `/hist/v4/performance/timeseries` (all-time)
  - `SaxoYTDInvestmentPerformanceSensor` from `/hist/v4/performance/timeseries` (year-to-date)
  - `SaxoMonthInvestmentPerformanceSensor` from `/hist/v4/performance/timeseries` (month-to-date)
  - `SaxoQuarterInvestmentPerformanceSensor` from `/hist/v4/performance/timeseries` (quarter-to-date)
  - `SaxoCashTransferBalanceSensor` from `/hist/v4/performance/timeseries` (with long-term statistics)
  - `SaxoClientIDSensor` - Client ID diagnostic information
  - `SaxoAccountIDSensor` - Account ID from `/port/v1/accounts/{AccountKey}` (hourly)
  - `SaxoNameSensor` - Client name from `/port/v1/clients/me` with `mdi:account-box` icon
  - `SaxoTokenExpirySensor` - OAuth token expiration monitoring
  - `SaxoMarketStatusSensor` - Real-time market status detection
  - `SaxoLastUpdateSensor` - Successful data update timestamp tracking
  - `SaxoTimezoneSensor` - Timezone configuration and market hours display
- **Automatic Client ID Naming**: Entity names use actual Saxo Client ID (e.g., `saxo_123456_cash_balance`)
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication with Home Assistant credential management (production endpoints only)
- **Market Hours**: Dynamic update intervals (5 min market hours, 30 min after hours)
- **Performance Caching**: Smart caching system that updates performance data hourly while maintaining real-time balance updates
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent API throttling with exponential backoff
- **Long-term Statistics**: Balance sensors support Home Assistant long-term statistics for historical tracking and trend analysis
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Built-in diagnostic support and real-time monitoring sensors
- **Optimized Architecture**: Shared base classes reduce code duplication by 31% while maintaining all functionality

### Entity Naming Pattern
- All entities use Client ID: `sensor.saxo_{client_id}_{sensor_type}`
- Examples with Client ID "123456":
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_cash_balance`
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_total_value`
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_non_margin_positions_value`
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_accumulated_profit_loss`
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_investment_performance`
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_ytd_investment_performance`
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_month_investment_performance`
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_quarter_investment_performance`
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_cash_transfer_balance`
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_client_id` (diagnostic)
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_account_id` (diagnostic)
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_name` (diagnostic)
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_token_expiry` (diagnostic)
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_market_status` (diagnostic)
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_last_update` (diagnostic)
  - `sensor.saxo_123456_timezone` (diagnostic)
- Device: `"Saxo {ClientId} Portfolio"`

### Configuration Options
- No user configuration needed - automatic Client ID detection
- Production endpoints only (no environment selection)
- Automatic token refresh with proper security handling
- Entity names automatically generated from Saxo Client ID

### Long-term Statistics Support
- **Historical Tracking**: Balance sensors store long-term statistics in Home Assistant's database
- **State Class Configuration**:
  - Balance sensors (Cash Balance, Total Value, Non-Margin Positions, Cash Transfer): `state_class = "measurement"`
  - Accumulated Profit/Loss: `state_class = "total"` (cumulative value)
- **Features Enabled**:
  - Extended history beyond standard 10-day retention
  - Statistics cards with min, max, mean values
  - Trend analysis over weeks, months, and years
  - Energy dashboard integration capability
- **Implementation**: `SaxoBalanceSensorBase` sets `_attr_state_class = "measurement"` at [sensor.py:180](custom_components/saxo_portfolio/sensor.py#L180)

### Conditional Sensor Creation
- **Unknown Client Name Protection**: Sensors are only created when client data is successfully retrieved from the Saxo API
- **Automatic Retry**: If client name is "unknown" during initial setup, sensor creation is skipped and automatically retried when client data becomes available
- **Config Entry Reload**: The integration automatically reloads the config entry when client data changes from "unknown" to a valid client name
- **Device Registration**: Home Assistant devices are only registered once valid client information is available, preventing orphaned devices
- **Enhanced Logging**: Clear warning messages when sensor setup is skipped due to unknown client data, with guidance for users

### Sticky Availability System

#### Enhanced Availability Logic
The integration implements a sophisticated "sticky availability" system to prevent sensors from flashing unavailable during normal coordinator updates:

**Problem Solved**: Home Assistant's `DataUpdateCoordinator` temporarily sets `last_update_success = False` at the start of each update cycle, causing sensors to briefly show as unavailable every 5-30 minutes.

**Solution**: Multi-tiered availability logic in `SaxoSensorBase.available` (Lines 84-123):

1. **Immediate Unavailable**: No data at all → `False`
2. **Immediate Available**: Current update successful → `True`
3. **Sticky Logic**: Update in progress but recent success → Check failure threshold
4. **Failure Threshold**: 15+ minutes OR 3+ failed update cycles → `False`

**Threshold Calculation**:
```python
max_failure_time = max(15 * 60, 3 * update_interval_seconds)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No UI flashing during normal 1-2 second API updates
- ✅ Quick detection of real authentication/network issues
- ✅ Adaptive thresholds (market hours: 5min, after hours: 30min)
- ✅ Graceful first startup and sustained failure handling

**Enhanced Sensors**:
- `SaxoAccumulatedProfitLossSensor`: Base availability + data validation
- `SaxoPerformanceSensorBase`: Base availability + performance value validation
- `SaxoCashTransferBalanceSensor`: Base availability + specific data checks

### Optimized Sensor Architecture

## Recent Changes (v2.2.11)
- **Critical Fix**: Fixed integration reloading every time OAuth token is refreshed
  - Token refresh triggered config entry update listener causing full integration reload/unload
  - Integration was restarting every 20 minutes during normal token refresh operations
  - Fixed in `__init__.py:async_options_updated()` to skip reload when coordinator is active
  - Coordinator now handles token updates internally via `api_client` property
  - Only triggers reload for actual configuration changes (timezone, etc.)
  - Impact: Prevents unnecessary restarts, improves stability, reduces log noise

## Recent Changes (v2.2.10)
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Fixed multiple bugs including performance cache, datetime handling, and error logging
  - Fixed performance cache never updating when client details are successfully fetched (coordinator.py:826-840)
    - Incorrect indentation caused cache update to only occur when client_details was None
    - Performance cache now properly updates every 2 hours as designed
    - This was defeating the entire caching mechanism and causing unnecessary API calls
  - Fixed duplicate condition check in SaxoLastUpdateSensor.native_value (sensor.py:947-957)
    - Removed redundant hasattr() check that was executed twice
  - Fixed naive datetime usage in sensor availability check (sensor.py:121-123)
    - Now uses dt_util.as_utc() instead of manual pytz.UTC.localize()
    - More consistent with Home Assistant datetime handling standards
  - Improved error handling in coordinator client details fetch (coordinator.py:804-809)
    - Now logs exception type and message for better debugging
  - Removed unused _fetch_performance_data() method from coordinator (dead code cleanup)
  - Updated test_sticky_availability.py to use UTC-aware datetimes
    - All 8 sticky availability tests now pass

## Recent Changes (v2.2.8-beta.1) - PRERELEASE

### Critical Timeout Fix
Fixed integration startup failures caused by nested timeout contexts introduced in v2.2.5.

#### Problem
- **Symptoms**: Integration fails to start since v2.2.5
  - Repeated "Request timeout (attempt 1/3)" warnings
  - 132+ seconds waiting for integration setup
  - Connection broken even with operational Saxo API
  - Worked correctly in v2.2.2

#### Root Cause Analysis
Commit `56b5332` (v2.2.5) introduced **triple-nested timeout contexts**:
1. `COORDINATOR_UPDATE_TIMEOUT` (90s) - outer coordinator timeout
2. `API_TIMEOUT_BALANCE/PERFORMANCE/CLIENT_INFO` (45s/60s/30s) - middle timeouts
3. API client's own `API_TIMEOUT_TOTAL` (45s) with retry logic - inner timeout

**The Problem**: Nested timeouts were racing with each other:
- API client times out at 45s and tries to retry (attempt 1/3)
- But `API_TIMEOUT_BALANCE` also fires at 45s, canceling the entire operation
- This causes retry counter to reset, showing "attempt 1/3" repeatedly
- The 90s coordinator timeout never triggers because operations keep restarting

#### Solution Implemented
Reverted to v2.2.2's proven single-layer timeout structure:

**Removed from const.py**:
- `API_TIMEOUT_BALANCE = 45s`
- `API_TIMEOUT_PERFORMANCE = 60s`
- `API_TIMEOUT_CLIENT_INFO = 30s`

**Restored**:
- `COORDINATOR_UPDATE_TIMEOUT = 30s` (was 90s in v2.2.5-2.2.7)

**Removed from coordinator.py** (5 locations):
- Line 542: Balance data fetch nested timeout
- Line 639: Client details fetch nested timeout
- Line 666: Performance v3 fetch nested timeout
- Line 719: Performance v4 fetch nested timeout
- Line 206: `_fetch_performance_data()` helper method timeout

#### Result
- ✅ Single coordinator timeout layer (30s)
- ✅ API client handles its own timeouts and retries without interference
- ✅ No timeout race conditions
- ✅ Restores working v2.2.2 behavior

#### Affected Versions
- **v2.2.5, v2.2.6, v2.2.7**: All had nested timeout issue
- **v2.2.2 and earlier**: Worked correctly
- **v2.2.8-beta.1**: Fix implemented (prerelease testing)

#### Testing Status
- ✅ Ruff linting: All checks passed
- ✅ Python syntax: Valid
- ⚠️ **Beta prerelease**: Awaiting user testing confirmation

## Recent Changes (v2.3.0-beta.1) - REVERTED

  - All tests updated to reflect the new optimized architecture

## Previous Changes (v2.1.2+)
- **Expanded to sixteen entities**: Added comprehensive portfolio monitoring including Month/Quarter performance tracking
- **Additional Performance Sensors**: Month-to-Date and Quarter-to-Date investment performance sensors
  - SaxoMonthInvestmentPerformanceSensor using "Month" StandardPeriod
  - SaxoQuarterInvestmentPerformanceSensor using "Quarter" StandardPeriod
- **Fixed Performance Sensor Timestamps**: Performance sensors now properly display last_updated attribute
  - Converted datetime objects to ISO format strings for Home Assistant display
  - Performance sensors show when performance data was last fetched from API
- **Display Name Sensor Icon Fix**: Fixed missing icon for SaxoNameSensor
  - Changed from invalid `mdi:account-card-details` to valid `mdi:account-box` icon
  - Added explicit icon property method for reliable display
- **OAuth Token Refresh Enhancement**: Added fallback redirect_uri for token refresh operations
  - Prevents token refresh failures when redirect_uri is missing from config entry
  - Uses standard Home Assistant OAuth redirect URL as fallback
- **Enhanced Diagnostic Suite**: Seven diagnostic entities for complete integration monitoring
  - Client ID and Account ID sensors for identification and troubleshooting
  - Display Name sensor with proper icon showing client name from API
  - Token Expiry sensor with countdown and status indicators
  - Market Status sensor showing current market state
  - Last Update sensor with timestamp tracking
  - Timezone sensor displaying configuration details
- **Performance Data Caching**: Smart hourly caching system for performance data to optimize API usage
  - Balance data: Updates every 5-30 minutes (real-time based on market hours)
  - Performance data: Updates every 1 hour (cached) - reduces API calls by ~90%
- **Code Deduplication**: Refactored performance sensors with SaxoPerformanceSensorBase class
- **Enhanced Sensor Attributes**: Improved attribute consistency across all sensors
  - Performance sensors include time_period attribute with StandardPeriod values ("AllTime"/"Year"/"Month"/"Quarter")
  - Fixed last_updated timestamps to match data source and format properly for display
- **V4 API Integration**: Added `/hist/v4/performance/timeseries` endpoint support for all time periods
- **Enhanced Data Coverage**: Now covers balance, performance (all periods), transfer, and system health data
