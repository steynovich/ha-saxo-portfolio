## Market Hours

The integration automatically detects market hours (Monday-Friday, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET) and adjusts update frequency accordingly:
- **Market Hours**: Updates every 5 minutes
- **After Hours**: Updates every 30 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failed**
- Verify your application credentials in the Saxo Developer Portal
- Ensure redirect URI is set to: `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`
- Check if your Saxo application has appropriate permissions

**Rate Limit Errors**
- The integration automatically handles rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Consider reducing update frequency if you have other applications using the same credentials

**Missing Data**
- Ensure your Saxo account has the required permissions for portfolio data
- Check if you're using the correct environment (simulation vs production)

### Enable Debug Logging

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.saxo_portfolio: debug
```

## API Limits

The integration respects Saxo's API limits:
- Maximum 120 requests per minute
