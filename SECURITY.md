# Security Guidelines for ha-saxo

This document outlines security best practices for users and developers of the Saxo Portfolio Home Assistant integration.

## User Security Guidelines

### 1. Application Credentials Management
- **Always use the simulation environment** initially to test the integration
- Create dedicated application credentials specifically for Home Assistant
- **Never share your App Key or App Secret** with others
- Store credentials securely using Home Assistant's Application Credentials system
- Rotate credentials periodically (recommended every 6 months)

### 2. OAuth Token Security
- OAuth tokens are automatically encrypted and stored in Home Assistant's config entries
- Tokens are automatically refreshed before expiration
- **Never manually copy or store OAuth tokens** outside of Home Assistant
- If you suspect token compromise, revoke access in the Saxo Developer Portal

### 3. Network Security
- Ensure Home Assistant instance uses HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for external access
- All API communication with Saxo uses HTTPS with certificate verification
- The integration respects Saxo's rate limits to prevent abuse

### 4. Environment Separation
- **Start with simulation environment** before switching to production
- Simulation environment uses `https://gateway.saxobank.com/sim/openapi`
- Production environment uses `https://gateway.saxobank.com/openapi`
- Environment selection is enforced at both authentication and API levels

### 5. Data Protection
- Portfolio data is only stored temporarily in Home Assistant's memory
- No sensitive financial data is logged in debug messages
- Error messages are sanitized to prevent information leakage

## Developer Security Guidelines

### 1. Credential Handling
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Use application credentials system
credentials = await async_get_application_credentials(hass, DOMAIN)
app_key = credentials.client_id

# ❌ WRONG - Never hardcode credentials
app_key = "hardcoded_key"
```

### 2. Error Handling
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Log error type, not details
_LOGGER.error("Authentication failed: %s", type(e).__name__)

# ❌ WRONG - Could leak sensitive information
_LOGGER.error("Authentication failed: %s", str(e))
```

### 3. API Security
- Always use HTTPS endpoints
- Implement proper SSL certificate verification
- Include rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Use secure random state parameters for OAuth

### 4. Token Management
- Access tokens should only be retrieved from config entries
- Implement token refresh before expiration
- Use secure storage provided by Home Assistant
- Log token operations at debug level only

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks
The integration includes:
- SSL certificate verification enforcement
- OAuth state parameter validation
- Rate limiting implementation
- Sanitized error logging

### Manual Security Review
Regularly review:
- Application credentials in Saxo Developer Portal
- Home Assistant access logs
- Integration error logs
- OAuth token expiration and refresh

## Incident Response

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not create a public GitHub issue**
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for investigation and fix

## Compliance

This integration follows:
- OAuth 2.0 security best practices
