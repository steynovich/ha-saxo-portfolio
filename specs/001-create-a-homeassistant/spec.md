## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Home Assistant user wants to monitor their Saxo Bank investment portfolio directly from their home automation dashboard, allowing them to track account performance, positions, and financial metrics alongside other home data without switching between applications.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Home Assistant instance with HACS installed, **When** the user searches for "Saxo Portfolio" in HACS, **Then** the integration appears as an installable component
2. **Given** the integration is installed, **When** the user provides valid Saxo API credentials, **Then** the system successfully authenticates and creates portfolio sensors
3. **Given** portfolio sensors are configured, **When** the user views their Home Assistant dashboard, **Then** current account balance, positions, and performance data are displayed
4. **Given** the integration is running, **When** market data changes, **Then** sensors update automatically within 5 minutes during market hours

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Saxo API credentials are invalid or expired?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues?
- What occurs when Saxo API rate limits are exceeded?
- How are multiple portfolios/accounts managed if user has several?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST be installable through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
- **FR-002**: System MUST meet HACS Gold status requirements for code quality and documentation
- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate with Saxo OpenAPI using OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant with PKCE flow
- **FR-004**: System MUST create Home Assistant sensors displaying portfolio data
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide account balance, individual positions, profit/loss data, and total portfolio value as sensors
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle API authentication failures gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- **FR-007**: System MUST refresh portfolio data every 5 minutes during market hours and every 30 minutes after market close
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect Saxo API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to configure which portfolio metrics are displayed as sensors
- **FR-010**: System MUST log integration events for troubleshooting purposes
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide configuration validation to ensure OAuth 2.0 credentials are correct
- **FR-012**: System MUST securely store and refresh OAuth 2.0 access tokens
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle OAuth token expiration and automatic renewal using refresh tokens

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Portfolio**: Represents a Saxo investment portfolio with account information, total value, and performance metrics
- **Account**: Individual Saxo trading account containing positions and balance information
- **Position**: Specific investment holdings with quantity, current value, and profit/loss data
- **Sensor**: Home Assistant entity that displays financial data with appropriate units and state information
