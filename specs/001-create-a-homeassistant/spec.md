# Feature Specification: Saxo Portfolio Home Assistant Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-homeassistant`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a HomeAssistant integration using HACS. It should be compatible with HACS Gold status. The purpose of this HomeAssistant integration is to provide sensors from Saxo Portfolio. Data can be collected using the Saxo SaxoOpenApi"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Description provides clear purpose: Saxo Portfolio sensors for Home Assistant
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Home Assistant users, HACS system
   → Actions: Install integration, configure portfolio access, monitor financial data
   → Data: Portfolio information, account balances, positions, performance metrics
   → Constraints: HACS Gold compatibility requirements
3. Clarifications resolved:
   → Portfolio metrics: Account balance, positions, P&L, total value
   → Authentication: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant with PKCE (amended: confidential Code grant without PKCE, see FR-003 note)
   → Data refresh: Every 5 minutes during market hours, 30 minutes after hours
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: Install via HACS → Configure API credentials → View portfolio sensors
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → HACS compatibility, sensor creation, data fetching, error handling
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Portfolio, Account, Position, Sensor
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Home Assistant user wants to monitor their Saxo Bank investment portfolio directly from their home automation dashboard, allowing them to track account performance, positions, and financial metrics alongside other home data without switching between applications.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Home Assistant instance with HACS installed, **When** the user searches for "Saxo Portfolio" in HACS, **Then** the integration appears as an installable component
2. **Given** the integration is installed, **When** the user provides valid Saxo API credentials, **Then** the system successfully authenticates and creates portfolio sensors
3. **Given** portfolio sensors are configured, **When** the user views their Home Assistant dashboard, **Then** current account balance, positions, and performance data are displayed
4. **Given** the integration is running, **When** market data changes, **Then** sensors update automatically within 5 minutes during market hours

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Saxo API credentials are invalid or expired?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues?
- What occurs when Saxo API rate limits are exceeded?
- How are multiple portfolios/accounts managed if user has several?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST be installable through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
- **FR-002**: System MUST meet HACS Gold status requirements for code quality and documentation
- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate with Saxo OpenAPI using OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant with PKCE flow *(amended, see note)*
  - *Note (2026-09, #23): PKCE is intentionally not used.* Saxo documents two separate grant types that are chosen when the app is registered: the **Authorization Code Grant** for server-side (confidential) apps, where the token request is authenticated with the AppKey and AppSecret via HTTP Basic Auth ([docs](https://www.developer.saxo/openapi/learn/oauth-authorization-code-grant)), and the **Authorization Code Grant with PKCE** for native (public) apps. The PKCE variant sends only `client_id` + `code_verifier`, with no secret, and requires the same `code_verifier` again on every refresh-token request ([docs](https://www.developer.saxo/openapi/learn/oauth-authorization-code-grant-pkce), [security overview](https://www.developer.saxo/openapi/learn/security)). Saxo does not document combining PKCE with a client secret. Home Assistant's `LocalOAuth2ImplementationWithPkce` also does not persist the verifier for refreshes. The integration therefore uses the confidential Authorization Code Grant: the App Secret is kept server-side in Home Assistant's Application Credentials, and the authorization code can only be redeemed with it. CSRF is covered by HA's signed `state` parameter. Verifying against Saxo SIM/LIVE whether a Code-grant app accepts `code_challenge` is left to the maintainer. If Saxo confirms that PKCE works alongside the secret, switching to PKCE is a follow-up.
- **FR-004**: System MUST create Home Assistant sensors displaying portfolio data
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide account balance, individual positions, profit/loss data, and total portfolio value as sensors
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle API authentication failures gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- **FR-007**: System MUST refresh portfolio data every 5 minutes during market hours and every 30 minutes after market close
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect Saxo API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to configure which portfolio metrics are displayed as sensors
- **FR-010**: System MUST log integration events for troubleshooting purposes
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide configuration validation to ensure OAuth 2.0 credentials are correct
- **FR-012**: System MUST securely store and refresh OAuth 2.0 access tokens
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle OAuth token expiration and automatic renewal using refresh tokens

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Portfolio**: Represents a Saxo investment portfolio with account information, total value, and performance metrics
- **Account**: Individual Saxo trading account containing positions and balance information
- **Position**: Specific investment holdings with quantity, current value, and profit/loss data
- **Sensor**: Home Assistant entity that displays financial data with appropriate units and state information
